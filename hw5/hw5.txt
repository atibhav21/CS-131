The code assumes that all arguments passed in as
listdiffs in the spec are proper listdiffs.
Additionally, the code also assumes that every argument
that is referred to as a listdiff in the spec returns
#t when checked with the "pair?" predicate
In the case of an error, as defined by the spec, 
the code displays error to the standard output.
The append-ld-helper procedure is there to avoid the
variadic arguments that might be passed into the 
append-ld procedure. 
Other than these facts, I am not aware of any shortcomings
in this code.
